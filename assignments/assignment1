Assignment #1:

The program doint.* calculates the integral of
a polynomial over a given range.  The coefficients
and the range are input along with tolerance 
parameters.

Rewrite as an MPI program that works on any
number of processors.  Each processor calculates
an equal portion of the integral in parallel. Each
then should print its given range and portion of
the integral.  The root processor then prints the
value of the whole integral as the sum of the
individual parts.


Extra challenge:
  Have the first processor do its portion of
the calculation then pass the results to the
second processor which adds its portion and
so on and have the last processor print the
final value.
