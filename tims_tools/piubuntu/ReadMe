Copy this directory to your home director:
mkdir ~/piubuntu
cp -r * ~/piubuntu

Go there:
cd ~/piubuntu

source runall

This will take about 6 hours


See the notes that Thomas MacKell from LANL
put together when doing an install.  Note
that you no longer need to install Slurm.
It is now installed by running the script.
However  munge and slurm need to be configured 
as he discusses.  With the example slurm.conf
file you will need to use the -exclusive 
flag to see all cores on the nodes.

Thanks Tom.  I highly recommend installing 
XFCE as he discusses below.  I can view the
session using MicroSoft Remote Desktop on 
my Mac.
