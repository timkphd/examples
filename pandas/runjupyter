**** Running Jupyter on compute nodes

** Get an interactive session.  For example:
srun --x11 --account=hpcapps --time=1:00:00 --partition=debug --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=8 --nodes=1 --pty bash

** Note the node you were given for your interactive session; for example r1i7n35

** May need to:
module purge
module load conda

** Then start jupyter
jupyter notebook --no-browser

After a few seconds you will see strings of the form:

http://localhost:8888/?token=23c9370aaf2f25f8a9ddfb4d0240940be9360c4984d51b26
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=23c9370aaf2f25f8a9ddfb4d0240940be9360c4984d51b26

** On your local machine run the following command.  You will need to replace 
r1i7n35 with the node on which you are running and maybe the 8888 with the 
left most number from the jupyter if it is different.

ssh -L 8888:localhost:9999 eagle ssh -L 9999:localhost:8888 r1i7n35

** If you get a message about port 8888 being busy try again with an different port, maybe 8887.

** Copy the http:localhost string from the window running jupyter to a browser
running on your local machine.  A notebook should open up.

** I should also work using 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost in your ssh command and
the browser.
