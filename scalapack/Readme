This page gives a number of Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL)
	examples, in particular calls to routines that are part of
	the SCALAPACK group of routines. There is a tar file that can
	be downloaded to RA that contains the source for the various
	programs, most in both C and Fortran, a Makefile, and a pbs
	script. The source for the examples, the Makefile and an run
	script can extracted from the tar file. You then do a make
	and submit the script to RA to run the example.

The first example is psgesv.f90. The original source was
	downloaded from
	http://acts.nersc.gov/scalapack/hands-on/example4.html but it
	was modified to be free format compliant. This example is
	designed to run using 6 processing cores.

The second example is ex1.f90 and ex1.c This example was
	discussed in the RA introductory workshops see:
	http://geco.mines.edu/workshop/class2. Ex1 is designed to run
	using 4 processing cores and again calls psgesv as its main
	routine.

The third example pdpttr_2.f90 and pdpttr_2.c shows the use of
	the ScaLAPACK routines PDPTTRF and PPPTTRS to factor and
	solve a symmetric positive definite tridiagonal system of
	linear equations Tx = b, in two distinct contexts, with two
	processors each and distinct right-hand sides. These examples
	were obtained from
	http://acts.nersc.gov/scalapack/hands-on/etc.html. This web
	page and its links are an excelent resource on SCALAPACK.

The final example, linsolve.f90 and linsolve.c goes back to
	PSGESV, but it is a more complete example. It also calls
	PSGEMV, PSAXPY, and PSNRM2 and does so in the context of a
	MPI program. This example is from chapter 15 of Pacheco,
	Peter S. Parallel Programming with MPI. San Francisco: Morgan
	Kaufmann, 1997. It has variable matrix sizes and processor
	layouts.
