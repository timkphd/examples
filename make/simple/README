There are three makefiles in this directory
makef, makec, and makefile.

makef - builds a Fortran program
makec - builds a C program
makefile - build both programs

The syntax to use a nonstandard file for make is
to list the file on the command line as shown
below

make -f makef
 or
make -f makec


The file st.in is input for the two programs.

The command
  make clean 
will remove all of the compiled codes.

The Fortran builds use the Portland Group compiler.  
You can edit the files to change this or use the
options on the command line to do so.  For example:

make -f makef -e F90=ifort
  or
make -e F90=ifort
