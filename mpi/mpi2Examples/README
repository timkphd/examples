The sources main0.py and main1.py show how to use the
MPI-2 commands:

    mpi_open_port	
    mpi_close_port		
    mpi_comm_accept		
    mpi_comm_connect	
    mpi_comm_disconnect

These commands allow two separate MPI jobs to connect
to each other.

These examples are designed to be run interactively.

Start one copy of each application in its own window.


mpiexec -n 1 main1.py



mpiexec -n 1 main0.py


The main1.py program will write a port_name string
to the terminal, something like

port= tag#0$port#54838$description#192.31.21.33$ifname#192.31.21.33$


The other program, main0.py, takes this string as input.

It will prompt using 

port_name>

Copy the string from the first window to the second inclosing it
in quotes.

After the two programs connect they send messages to each other 
and quit.

The file capture.png shows a screen dump of terminals windows running
these two programs.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The program tspawn.py, worker.c, worker.py show how to use the
routines

	mpi_comm_spawn
	mpi_comm_get_parent
	
In this example tspawn.py spawns the two other MPI programs.
It communicates with worker.py using both collective and 
point-to-point routines

To launch this example you only run tspawn.py using a command like

mpiexec -n 1 tspawn.py
